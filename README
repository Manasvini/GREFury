GREFury is an Android application for learning new words for the purpose of GRE preparation.
In the practice mode, the user is given a set of 10 words, which they have to guess, in a way similar to hangman.
Every word has a time limit.
The user has the option of asking for a hint, which will basically show the meaning and the usage of the word.
GREFUry has been built with Java, PHP, MySQL and SQLite
PHP and MySQL are used for the purpose of user registration
SQLite is the data store for the words and their definitions
